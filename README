Web Server
This is a simple web server program written in C. The server uses a thread pool to handle incoming requests in parallel, and it uses the socket API to read incoming requests and send responses to clients.

Features
Handles multiple incoming requests in parallel using a thread pool
Parses incoming requests to extract the method, path, and protocol
Checks for errors in the request, such as a missing method, path, or protocol
If the request is valid, the program checks the file type and sends the file to the client if it exists
If the file does not exist, the program sends an error message to the client
Usage
To run the server, compile the program using a C compiler and then run the executable file. The server will listen on the specified port for incoming requests.

Note
It is important to note that this is a basic implementation of a web server and it does not include all the features that a production-ready server would have, such as handling multiple file types, security features, and handling large number of requests.

Dependencies
This program depends on stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h, unistd.h, sys/socket.h, netinet/in.h, sys/stat.h, dirent.h, and fcntl.h libraries.
